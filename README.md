# TJBot

This is a program coded in Node.js for TJBot.  It is a basic sample application that allows you to:
* run pre-prepared conversation
* control RGB light on TJBot's head
* control TJBot's arm
* use camera to take a picture and analyze it


_Note: TJBot's name is Michael, unless you change it in config.js file. So when you speek to TJBot, use "Michael" in your sentence. Only then will he process the sentence._
